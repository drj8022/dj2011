					<p>The goal of the Sustainable Connected Home is to conduct advanced research on renewable energy systems, social sustainability, and connected information systems.</p>
					<p>I knew this site would need to perform two functions. It would have to look elegant and deliver information quickly, as it would be shown to individuals with big budgets and small amounts of time. Additionally, a variety of researchers from different disciplines would be contributing new content, each with a different level of comfort with the web.</p>
					<p>I chose to use Wordpress as a CMS for its clean looking administrative pages, and easy to develop themes. The final site allowed ease of use for contributors, while maintaining a sleek look.</p>

					<p>Created at The Massachusetts College of Art and Design, this poster maps weather patterns against sports and crime data for the city of Boston during 2007. I doodled the basic design in a few minutes, and then painstakingly translated the data into Illustrator by hand.</p>
					<p>I really enjoyed the challenge of turning these piles of abstract data into something that people could view quickly, and instantly grasp the larger meaning.</p>
					<p>It was interesting to see the spike in crime during the (lost) super bowl, and the dip when the Red Sox won the world series. Was weather the cause? Fans? Maybe just circumstantial? The fun part of this project is that the viewer is challenged to be the judge.</p>

				<h1>The Sound Machine</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>The goal of the Sound Machine is to give people with limited or no musical background the experience of being a performer. The Sound Machine is designed to challenge users to communicate in modes, non-verbally for example, that they may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with. Screens are omitted in an attempt to push the computer into the background, allowing participants the freedom to focus on their fellow performers.</p>
					<p>I love music, but I am not a musician, so this project really excited me. I have always enjoyed watching the dynamics that occur between performing musicians. I wondered if such communication, informed by those professional individuals knowledge of music, would be possible to replicate using non-musicians. This project also presented itself as a great platform for moving away from screen-based media and into physical interfaces.</p>
					<p>For me, that moment of interest was the litmus test for the project's ultimate success. It was great to see my passion rewarded when a group of friends got together and shared a smile at the experience. It was even more rewarding to see groups of strangers using the machine to form an impromptu community.</p>

				<div class="body">
					<p>The MIT Mobile Experience Lab seeks to radically reinvent and creatively design connections between people, information and physical places. I built their site using Drupal, taking Photoshop templates provided by an Interactive agency and doing all the leg work necessary in order to bring this site to life.</p>
					<p>Although this was a development project, I wound up doing some design work here as well. The templates accounted for only about 60% of the full site. Sometimes I added in full pages, other times I resolved smaller interface issues that were not considered by the designer.</p>
					<p>Additionally, some of the lab's projects were not formatted for the web. I went through the archives of each project, selecting images that told the story best. What resulted was a smart interface that provides the user with an engaging picture of the research being done at the lab.</p>

					<p>Locast is a flexible location based platform that combines distributed web and mobile applications to create hyperlocal experiences. The project was developed by a team of 12 at the MIT Mobile Experience Lab in 2009.</p>
					<p>My role on this project was to develop the web based information architecture. We initially put together some basic user profiles, which helped us decide on which experiences to emphasize for the web. I tried experimenting with some different ways to visualize popular content using thickness of line and color.</p>
					<p>We simply didn’t have time to refine (or even include!) all the features we hoped for. But the thoroughness of the wireframes allowed the developers to concentrate on their jobs, instead of filling in incomplete designs.</p>

Their stated mission is to explore the evolution of the music formerly known as classical.</p>
					<p>BMOP commissioned this site redevelopment with two primary needs in mind. First, they had managed their ticketing and sales office by hand and really needed to streamline that process. Secondly, they had a huge amount of archived content they wished to share.</p>
					<p>I took advantage of Drupal's excellent Ubercart module to build BMOP's online storefront. Other modules helped me quickly construct a site where each piece of content is tightly integrated with the others, creating a product that increased BMOP's capacity while showcasing their impressive collection of material.</p>

				<h1>Garden City</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>Garden City connects gardeners from around the world. It is designed to be used by urban gardeners at all skill levels. It is a platform to ask questions and provide answers, or simply share information about past experiences.</p>
					<p>I became inspired after reading Michael Pollan’s open letter to the president-elect, encouraging him to grow a garden on the south lawn of the White House. Sure, the president can figure this stuff out, but could everyone? I attempted to answer the novice's inevitable question, "Where do I start?"</p>
					<p>The still shown here attempts to answer that question by visualizing the time and space requirements of a garden. The metaphor of a meal is used to provide a simple to understand starting point.</p>
					<p>Through the research done on this project I came to realize it wasn’t the garden that held my interest. It was questions dealing with how community is formed, and how experiences are shared between community members.</p>

				<h1>Green Link</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>Green Link was a partnering of the MIT Mobile Experience Lab and the Italian Trade Commission to explore sustainable best practices. A symposium was planned to showcase green developments in home building.</p>
					<p>I developed the identity shown here as well as some print collateral. Additionally, I created two web sites. The first was a simple piece of brochureware. The second would have been more complex; requiring affordances for users, content creation, and tagging.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, after the symposium, there simply wasn't much interest in the Green Link, and the project was cancelled. Still, I like the mark. The childlike shape of a house visible in the negative space contrasts nicely with the machined look of the typeface, Centro Pro.</p>

				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Hi! My name is Dan. I am interested in using dynamic media to create shared experiences for our increasingly specialized world. I currently work as a front-end developer at a small design agency based in Boston. I've studied Industrial Design at <a href="http://cias.rit.edu/" class="offsite" target="_blank">RIT</a> ('01), and more recently Dynamic Media at <a href="http://www.dynamicmediainstitute.org/" class="offsite" target="_blank">MassArt</a> ('09).</p>
				<p>Born and raised in Boston I now find myself in Chicago; experiencing all the joys and frustrations moving to a new city brings. Please get in touch if you have a great idea for the next big project, or if you would just like to grab some coffee!</p>
				<p><h2>About the site</h2>It's dangerous to go alone!
